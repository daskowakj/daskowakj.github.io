<h1> Cousera Guided Projects for Power BI Dashboards </h1>
<p> As part of an effort ot learn Power BI, I completed guided projects supplied by Coursera. The downfall of free access to the Power BI app, is that there is no way to embed the dashboard to an external website because I do not have access to Power BI service.Therefore, the dashboard will be shown as pdf that can be found here. 
</p>

<p>
<h2> Getting Started with Power BI Desktop </h2>
<h4> My Rating 5/5 </h4>
My first dashboard in PowerBI using data found <a href="https://doi.org/10.24432/C55S3H">here</a>. The instructor of the course edited the dataset to randomly distribute the clients across all 50 states of America. The pdf of the dashboard is available <a href="files/project1pbi.pdf">here</a>. In this project, data were imported into Power BI Desktop, data were transformed using Power Query and loaded into the workspace. Two slicers are included to show tailored demographic information relevant to default rates across age, sex, education level, and fictional location.
</p>

<p>
<h2> Prepare, Clean, Transform, and Load Data using Power BI </h2> 
<h4> My Rating 5/5 </h4>
This guided project demonstrated simple ETL processes using Power Query. There was not a publishable deliverable. This guided project was a great hands-on tool for ETL in Power Query.
</p>

<p>
<h2> Use Power BI for Financial Data Analysis </h2>
<h4> My Rating 3/5 </h4>
The dashboard creating in this guided project used data sourced from <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/sample-financial-download">here</a>. It contains sample financial data generated by Microsoft. The dashboard has been exported to pdf and can be found <a href="files/project3pbi.pdf">here</a>. The instructor moved much too fast in this project. 
</p>

<p>
<h2> Build Dashboards in Microsoft Power BI </h2>
<h4> My Rating 2/5 </h4>
The dashboard created in this guided project used data from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_by_continent">Wikipedia</a>. The output deliverable is not worthy of publication. The guided project was primarily for use as a tutorial in publishing dashboards on Power BI Service. 
</p> 

<p>
<h2> HR Analytics- Build an HR dashboard using Power BI </h2>
<h4> My Rating 3/5 </h4>
The dashboard introduced two new concepts, buttons and changing the report background with an image uploaded by the user. The dashboard can be found <a href="files/project5pbi.pdf">here</a>.
